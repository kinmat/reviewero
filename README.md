Reviewero is my thesis project for my Bachelors in Computer Engineering.

## Abstract
Nowadays social media websites have become an integral part of our everyday lives. The fact that they can be reached from almost any device with an internet connection largely contributes to their wide spread over the world. Due to the development of technology these devices can be found in most households.


It seems that the easiest way to build your own community for certain interests and hobbies is on a social media website created for this exact purpose. Today, several book-catalog type websites have been created, the functions of which include searching their database, creating your own lists of books, and writing reviews. Still, no such website has been created yet, that has been designed to build a community of book readers, using chat functions. This is the gap, that my application is meant to fill.


The aim of the thesis is to create a web application that provides a community interface for book readers. The technology used to create the application is Angular framework for the frontend part and Spring Boot framework for the backend part. The main requirements for the application are that the user can create their own profile, log in, and initiate a conversation with another user.
